**RetailEase POS Software: 💵** 

RetailEase Point of Sale software was created to help small businesses handle their finances with ease and simplicity. This project was in development for 3 months, and regularly receives updates when I find bugs in the program. I have built this project in Delphi 2010 and built it to run on Windows.

**Functions & Features: ⚙️**

- User Accounts; Admin and Local accounts
- Creation of Accounts
- Enrolling and editing stock: name, price, stock levels
- Calculating Change
- Enrolling and editing existing and new users

To install, simply go to [Releases](https://github.com/bellic-code/RetailEase/releases/tag/v1.0.0) and download the latest version. Upon launching the executable, you will be greeted by the installer. Follow it, and it will guide you on how to install the app. After that you can find it in your 🪟 Start Menu and begin using it.
